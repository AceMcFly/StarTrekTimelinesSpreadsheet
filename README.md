# Star Trek Timelines Spreadsheet Tool
A tool to help with crew management in Star Trek Timelines

**NOTE** This tool does not (and will never) automate any part of the game play; its sole purpose is to help players organize their crew using the functionality built within or with a spreadsheet application of their choice.

## Install and run the tool

I recommend you install the development environment and play with the source code yourself; make improvements and submit PRs to help your fellow players. See [contribution guidelines](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

However, if you're only interested in installing and running the tool, head on to the [releases](https://github.com/IAmPicard/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet/releases) page and pick a recent release to install.

### Crew recommendations

![Screenshot CrewRecommendations](/docs/Screenshot-CrewRecommendations.png "CrewRecommendations screenshot")

*Work in progress!*

This tab will make recommendations about which crew you can freeze or airlock, and which you need to keep in your active roster, primarily for cadet challenges.

### Gauntlet

![Screenshot Gauntlet](/docs/Screenshot-Gauntlet.png "Gauntlet screenshot")

In this tab you can get recommendations for which crew to use in your next gauntlet (if you didn't already start it), and odds for crew matches (if you already started a gauntlet). Please see source code for details, the algorithm is still "hand-wavy" at this point and could use input from someone more experienced with statistical analysis.

### Fleet

![Screenshot Fleet](/docs/Screenshot-Fleet.png "Fleet screenshot")

Basic information about your fleet such as a member list with their last online and event ranks and starbase rooms' status.

### Share your crew stats

![Screenshot Sharing](/docs/Screenshot-ShareOnline.png "Sharing screenshot")

You can export a formatted html page with your crew stats and (optionally) your mission completion stats either to the local PC or directly upload it online, ready to send a link wherever you want - maybe your fleet-mates or to the forum / reddit / discord to ask for advice or just brag :wink: .

## Development environment

### To get started:
* Run `npm install`

##### Development
* Run `npm run dev` to start webpack-dev-server. Electron will launch automatically after compilation.

##### Production
_You have two options, an automatic build or two manual steps_

###### One Shot
* Run `npm run package` to have webpack compile your application into `dist/bundle.js` and `dist/index.html`, and then an electron-packager run will be triggered for the current platform/arch, outputting to `builds/`

###### Manual
_Recommendation: Update the "postpackage" script call in package.json to specify parameters as you choose and use the `npm run package` command instead of running these steps manually_
* Run `npm run build` to have webpack compile and output your bundle to `dist/bundle.js`
* Then you can call electron-packager directly with any commands you choose

If you want to test the production build (In case you think Babili might be breaking something) after running `npm run build` you can then call `npm run prod`. This will cause electron to load off of the `dist/` build instead of looking for the webpack-dev-server instance. Electron will launch automatically after compilation.


## Command line version of the tool
